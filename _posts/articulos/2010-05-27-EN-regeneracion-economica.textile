One of the most important points in our research is the necessity of being able to generate an economic activity that influences positively in its surroundings. In neighborhoods that requires a social and economic regeneration big investments need to be done in the creation and maintenance of basic care centers. These centers are essential in order for the regeneration process to be a success. At the same time, these neighborhoods need additional initiatives to help in a medium-term regeneration of the economic and productive activities. The introduction of an independent creative space would satisfy this immediate need without requiring big investments.
