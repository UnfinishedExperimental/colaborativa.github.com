Village Underground is a unique initiative located in a section of the Broad Street Rail Viaduct cutting through the middle of Shoreditch, London. Auro Foxcroft, a young industrial designer, envisioned a commnity where creatives could access to affordable workspaces providing at the same time a wide range of cultural activity.

Village Underground opened in April 2007, four underground carriages were converted into unique workspaces for creative entrepeneurs and the adjacent derelict Victorian warehouse refurbished into a multifunctional arena for gigs, art exhibitions,music performances, theatre, showcases, product launches, exhibitions, conferences and club nights.

The project has proven to be very successful and they are already creating a second “village” in Berlin. In Auro’s words “We’re providing a real community. After all, without affordable workspace, where are the next generation of creatives going to come from?”
